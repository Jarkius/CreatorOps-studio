# Working Notes (handoff for the next session)

Read this first when resuming. It is a compact summary; the authoritative documents are listed in `docs/README.md`. Update it at the end of each session (keep it short).

**Last updated:** 2026-11-04 · **Branch:** `ccr-14958772-bzlatd` · **Phase:** 2 complete, Phase 3 not started.

## Where we are

| Phase | State |
|---|---|
| 0 Foundation (monorepo, CI, config, redaction, local Postgres) | done |
| 1 Extension shell + API foundation (mock auth, dashboard shell, MV3 side panel) | done |
| 2 Workspaces, products, media (API, dashboard, extension product view, uploads, signed media) | done; see the exit check in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` |
| 3 Content generation with a mock provider (jobs, Redis + BullMQ per D-006) | **next**; needs an advisor slice breakdown first |
| 4+ real providers, export, publishing | blocked on open questions Q-001, Q-002, Q-005 (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`) |

Tests at the last full run: unit/integration 471+ (api 238, web 102, extension 48, ui 43, contracts 27, config 12, provider-core 1); end-to-end 37 (14 extension, 23 dashboard).

## How to run things

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev:db                                   # PostgreSQL 16 without Docker (scripts/pg-local.sh)
export DATABASE_URL="$(bash scripts/pg-local.sh url)"
pnpm db:migrate && pnpm db:seed               # dev database
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build && pnpm format:check
export PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers
pnpm e2e                                      # builds, then both suites, each on a fresh creatorops_e2e database
```

`pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` build first (packages consume each other's `dist`). Database tests fail loudly without `DATABASE_URL` (`SKIP_DB_TESTS=1` skips on purpose).

## Working method (this project's rules)

- One vertical slice at a time: contract, backend and tests, UI, states, lint/typecheck/tests, docs and status (`docs/08_PHASE_PLAN.md`, skill `app-dev-methodology`, D-022).
- Delegation (D-031): Haiku workers build mechanical slices from tightly written specs; the orchestrator verifies every slice by running the checks itself and writes the security-sensitive code; the Opus advisor reviews read-only at checkpoints (before each phase, and after each security-relevant phase).
- Mutation-check security rules: break the code on purpose and confirm a test fails. Verify the edit really applied (Prettier reflows code, so scripted string replacements silently miss).
- Commit only verified work. The stop hook asks for a commit whenever the tree is dirty: commit the verified subset and say what is left out.

## Gotchas learned the hard way

- Never rebuild `apps/api/dist` or shared packages while a worker is running E2E: the E2E server runs from `dist`. Workers run package-scoped commands only; the orchestrator runs the repo-wide ones.
- Vitest reports "Unhandled Errors" (exit code 1) even when every test passes. Treat it as a failure: it found a process-crashing upload bug.
- Drizzle wraps Postgres errors: look through `error.cause` for the code.
- `z.coerce` makes a schema's input type `unknown`; use the parsed (`z.infer`) type in services.
- The production-style `pg-local.sh` runs the server as user `pgdev` when invoked as root; the data parent `.data/` must stay root-owned.
- The 1x1 PNG some snippets use has a bad CRC; sharp rightly rejects it.
- Playwright cannot click the real extension toolbar or drive the side-panel UI; the panel page is loaded as a tab and the behaviour checked through `chrome.sidePanel.getPanelBehavior()`.

## Not verified / known gaps

- Real toolbar click in Chrome; GitHub Actions has never run (including the e2e job and gitleaks).
- Visual layout and real screen readers (only automated axe checks).
- Extension does not show product images yet (the CSP already allows them since S3.0); current-page import deferred (D-019).
- Pin GitHub Actions to commit SHAs before the first release.

## Open questions that need the owner

Q-001 text provider, Q-002 image/video provider and spending cap, Q-005 Thai evaluation reviewers (before Phase 4); Q-003/Q-004/Q-007 hosting, auth provider and storage vendor (before any hosted deployment); Q-006 extension distribution (before a beta). Defaults are listed in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Next steps

1. Workspace-creation screen: done and verified. Asset library now gated.
2. Phase 3 plan is recorded as D-045 to D-054 (advisor reviewed). S3.0 (Phase 2 cleanups) is done; next is S3.1 (contracts, TextProvider and mock, templates, claim guard), then S3.2 onward in order.
